# MOBLIMA

## About
A group project created during SC2002(Object Oriented Design & Programming). 
MOBLIMA is a virtual centralised console-based application which connects Admins of the Cineplexes and Movie Viewers. It enables Viewers to make online bookings and purchase tickets to movies, view details on all running movies in particular Cineplexes, view the various movies which are now showing, as well as to view the show times for each movie and their corresponding seat availability. 
The application is built by effectively making use of Object Oriented Design Principles to provide an efficient Movie Booking Interface, both for the Viewers and the Administration.
